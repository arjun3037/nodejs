# How NodeJs works
    * When Node server receive a request from client , then it will push all the requests in Event Queue.
    * after this all request goes to Event loop , so Event loop always listen to Event queue . When Event queue gets request it will pickup the requesy in FIFO manner
    * There can be two type of request 1) Blocking request (sync) 2) Non-blocking request (async).
    * In case of Non-blocking opeation Event loop process non-blocking request normally.
    * But in case of blocking request a thread assigned from thread pool to complete the request. 
    * By default threadpool size is 4 , we can configure threadpool size max to cpu core size.
